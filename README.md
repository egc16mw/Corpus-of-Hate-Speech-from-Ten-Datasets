# NLP_MSc_MW
Cleaned and pre-processed tokenized 10 datasets and untokenized 10 datasets with Tweets for the Subjectivity Space model (NLP and DL project).
 The creation of large-size hate-speech corpora is a major contribution to The University of Sheffield's MSc Dissertation project I worked on as well as to the field of NLP. The corpora will be utilized for the new task and the new model presented in my MSc project. There is no large-size, comprehensive
corpora of hate speech available, and therefore this is a contribution to the field as well.
